- 👋 Welcome!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, especially in Font-end development.
- 🌱 That is why I've already finished training on git/shell, html5, css3, sass pre-processor, rest api, python basics, JavaScript, currently learning Django and still ahead of me React.
- 💞️ I’m looking for an opportunity to become Junior Front-end Developer.
- 📫 You will google me easily, but in case you don't want to waste your time, here's my email: marek.derlukiewicz@gmail.com.
